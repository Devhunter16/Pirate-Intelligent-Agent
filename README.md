# Pirate-Intelligent-Agent
This is a project where I solved a pathfinding problem by using deep Q-learning in order to teach an intelligent agent "Pirate" to solve a maze by finding the treasure within. The code that I wrote myself is in between the (# Code that I wrote myself ) comments in the PirateAgent file.
